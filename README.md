# Playlist Pilot üéµ

A modular FastAPI app that helps you generate, analyze, and manage music playlists using GPT, and Jellyfin.

## üöÄ Features

- Generate playlists based on moods, genres or similar tracks
- Pull audio data from Jellyfin
- Suggest additional tracks using GPT with Last.fm enrichment
- Download missing tracks via MeTube/yt-dlp
- Analyze playlists for mood, tempo and popularity
- Sample your Jellyfin library to seed new ideas
- Export playlists as `.m3u` or directly back to Jellyfin
- Import `.m3u` files into your history
- Update track metadata in Jellyfin
- View and manage suggestion history
- Editable configuration from the web UI
- Docker & Docker Compose ready

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` OR use Docker
- Run tests with `pytest`

## üê≥ Docker Usage

Build and run with Docker Compose. Provide the location of your settings file
and music library using environment variables:

```bash
HOST_SETTINGS_FILE=/path/to/your/settings.json \
HOST_MUSIC_DIR=/path/to/your/music \
docker compose up --build
```

If these variables are not set, the compose file falls back to example paths.

See [Docs/docker_compose_installation.md](Docs/docker_compose_installation.md) for a step-by-step setup guide.

Then open your browser to: [http://localhost:8010](http://localhost:8010)
If required settings are missing, you'll be automatically redirected to the
settings page to enter them.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Visit [http://localhost:8010/settings](http://localhost:8010/settings) to set:

- Jellyfin URL, API key, and User ID
- OpenAI API key
- Last.fm API key
- Model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)

These are saved in `settings.json`.
