# Advanced Usage

Once you are comfortable generating playlists there are several ways to customise Playlist Pilot.

- **Weights** – The influence of lyrics, BPM and Last.fm tags on mood detection can be tweaked in the settings page.
- **Cache control** – Clear individual caches from the settings page or via the CLI to force fresh lookups.
- **Library scans** – Increase `library_scan_limit` if your Jellyfin library is large and you want more tracks analysed per request.
- **Models** – Provide your own OpenAI model name if you have access to a custom one.

These options allow power users to fine‑tune the suggestion engine and metadata enrichment process.
