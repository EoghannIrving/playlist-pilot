# Playlist Management

The History page keeps a record of every playlist suggestion that has been generated. From here you can:

- Download the suggestion as an `.m3u` file.
- Delete old entries you no longer need.
- Compare two saved suggestions or Jellyfin playlists via the **Compare** page.

You can also import existing M3U files which will be stored in your history for later analysis and export to Jellyfin.
