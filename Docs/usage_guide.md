# Usage Guide

This document provides a quick walkthrough of the typical workflow once Playlist Pilot is installed and configured.

## Generating playlists

1. Open the web interface at [http://localhost:8010](http://localhost:8010).
2. On the home page enter a mood, genre or a short list of seed tracks.
3. Click **Suggest** and GPT will return a list of tracks with short explanations.
4. Review the suggestions, edit any tracks if needed and press **Save** to create the playlist in Jellyfin.

You can also download the results as an `.m3u` file from the history page.

## Viewing history

- The **History** link in the navigation bar lists all past suggestions for the current Jellyfin user.
- Entries are sorted by date with the newest first. Selecting one shows the full suggestion list and provides buttons to export or delete the entry.

## Managing playlists

Use the **Playlists** page to view existing Jellyfin playlists. From here you can compare two playlists or analyse a playlist's mood distribution.
